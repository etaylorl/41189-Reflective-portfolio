# 41189-Reflective-portfolio Week 1: Systems 
## What have I learnt this week?
Knowing very little about human centred complex systems this was a very interesting introduction as I was very unsure what this subject was about. 
I also began to learn how to use canvas as a learning tool as i had never used it before with none of my subjects being on there. This meant finding the layout and set up of this subject which was divided into pre, during and post work. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
It was very interesting looking at the meaning of systems, 'group of interacting/ interrelated entities that form a united whole'. Which made me question the different systems around me and their different roles involved. As systems has been a word that has been used freely to describe many things I didn't realise the variety and complexity of this meaning. In particularly the complexity of these systems and the way that they must adapt to survive and play an important role.
## What insights have I gained?
I have learnt about the different boundaries and characteristics of systems, which I was very unaware of before. Ultimately many different things can be systems depending on their boundaries, surroundings and influences to make it an open, closed or isolated system. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have learnt that I know information about these topics, but i need to refine my language and details about the topics. As this is all a very new learning experience and I need to stay organised and on top of the work to do well. There is a lot of new terminology as well which means i need to ensure i have done the pre and post work as well as textbook areas to help me learn. 

# Week2 models
## What have I learnt this week?
	
This weeks focus was on the importance of models and this gave me an insight into the complexity and variety of these different models. As people use models in their day to day life this structure can vary to different degrees because models are a substitute of a system. Helping people to visualise and execute ideas that they may have. There were many different important examples that were used throughout helping to create a better understanding about these models. It was important to know the one to many approach as some models can be applicable to many different cases, but also unique individual models are necessary to be the most accurate. 
	
## What do I now know that I did not before?
	
In particular I learnt about the different approaches for the types of models that are appropriate for individual unique situations. The embodiment approach focuses on realism for models that are necessary to make change and necessary for day to day life like traffic systems. Whereas the analogy approach captures the process of the system e.g. The spreading of a disease and how this can be controlled and stopped. Finally an alternative reality is used to rediscover general insights and doesn't really represent or capture reality. I also found modelling vs. Observation a very important topic area that was covered, letting me think about other decisions I had made in previous tasks.
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed 
As I had done the pre-work to a high standard  and before the tutorial, this meant that I had a good foundational knowledge to know and understand what the tutor was talking about during the tutorial. I was able to pick up more information, ideas and different insights building on my current knowledge. However I need to learn the technical information better to strengthen my understanding. Similarly it would be a good idea to do my reflections on the day or day after to remember the full representation of my experience. 

# Reflection week 3
  ## What have i learnt this week?
 
	I have applied previous knowledge about models from last weeks workshop, to be able to build on the new examples and applications in this weeks learning materials. It was very interesting looking at the different models of signalling which identify various conditions under which people send costly signals to reveal information or their type. This can look at things such as conspicuous consumption entailing what other people think of us and what we consume signals our status to others e.g. Buying an expensive car. Whereas cost signalling looks at the meaning or significance that a person attaches to something which is felt in direct proportion to the expense at which it is communicated. This can include hidden action and information by people which is only demonstrated through outcomes. 
	
## What do i now know that i did not before?
	Particularly looking at value and power it was interesting to see these different measures as well as cooperative games to assist with this. The last on the bus value looks at the actor's marginal contribution given that the group has already formed. Whereas shapely value looks at the actor's average marginal contribution across all possible sequences of adding people to a group. 
	
	As well as problem solving the process of perspectives → Heuristics → Team diversity → Recombination = Innovation was a process that was interesting to read about and understand. 
	
## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
	We have just formed groups for upcoming group and team assignments, i am in a team of four. One of the girls I have worked with previously in another subject last semester however I have never met her, but I know that we work fairly well together and get along. It will be a challenge working together with the two other girls later in the semester as I don't really know anything about them as a person or their abilities. But as the weeks go buy hopefully we can organise well and achieve tasks. We have established a communication group and platform as well which is a good progressing start.
	
# Reflection week 4
	
## What have i learnt this week?
	
This week allowed me to thoroughly build on my previous knowledge of systems and models from the other workshops. To also being able to add different areas about networks. I learnt about the dynamic and evolving nature of systems and how they have boundaries and different parts. As systems are defined by their interrelationships, functionality and potential which can be affected when one system is taken away from another. These boundaries can be macro and micro e.g. A pool vs. An ocean this size is very different. I also enjoyed learning about the different fundamental modes of interaction including exponential growth, goal setting and oscillation demonstrating how systems interact with each other. 

## What insights have i gained?
	Through learning this theory, it was also very interesting to watch a video at the end of the lesson which put together all the different theories and information that we had learnt. And to see it being used and applied to a real life example, this was particularly interesting to see big business' taking action. 
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed 
Similarly to other weeks, I have found a strength in my learning habits through doing the pre work early and before the commencement of the lesson. This makes it much easier for me to retain the information as the tutor is talking about it, rather than learning it for the first time. Which helps enhance my understanding and learning abilities across these topics.
	
I have also found cross over with some of the theory in this class with the other subjects that I have been doing. Which makes it easier to understand and expand my knowledge as well as previous subjects that i have done. Such as learning about nodes and network formations. 
	
However I have become less motivated to write my reflections after class, as my schedule for the second half of the week is fairly busy. But I am trying to do this earlier even if it means planning the reflection after class and then writing it later in the week. As this is a very important life skill and learning tool that is necessary. 

# Week 5 reflection
## What have i learnt this week?
Week 5's module was about aggregating decisions and behaviours mostly focusing on the importance of probability. Aggregation focused on non-linear models which required agents and behaviours to provide outcomes and change. Which is very useful for predicting, understanding data and working through logic. It was important to get an idea about the different distributions of probability which represent the random values and outcomes of a situation. In particular discrete random values which can be calculated by counting the number of possible outcomes compared to continuous random variables which have an infinite number of possible values and need to be calculated through measuring. Similarly looking at the shape of the diagrams and the six sigma deviation i really enjoyed learning that 68% of probability lies in one standard deviation from the mean, 95% in 2 and 1 in 3.4 million in 6 standard deviations. As well learning about linear models was good to understand the basics of probability as this is popularly used to make simple predictions and look at data initially. This is a good way to understand the data but realistically we live in a non linear world so it can be hard to predict some functions 
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed ?
As I am currently studying statistics in my double degree of information systems and business, much of the probability was familiar to me. It was good to build on to previous knowledge that I had just recently learnt while also learning about applications to the real world. Without having to worry about the formulas, I was able to clearly get world application and examples through this recap. I also did my reflection earlier this week, and will leave the pre work and readings till before the workshop. 
	
However, I need to make myself clearer on a few concepts learnt in class as well as get an idea about the upcoming assessment and what needs to be done for that. To be able to have a good understanding before contributing to group work and planning the different aspects for the future. 
	
## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
	
For next lesson we need to start brainstorming models and problem ideas with our team, as well as choose a team leader. Although we have already established our group and got a clear social media for communication between everyone, we haven't yet completed this. However I am sure over the weekend we will be able to communicate over text or the phone to come to this decision to make sure that we are up to date and ready for class. However it is good to know that everyone is involved and contributing as well as coming to class and engaging with the content. 

# Week 6 reflection
## What have i learnt this week?
This weeks topic was about how complex systems evolve with time and I learnt about path dependence and the different urn models. The importance of path development happens in the moment but depends on preceding moments and the path that is taken to get there, such as development in technology and the law. And this is built on with Urn models as they describe path dependence while distinguishing between models that are path dependent and 'phat' dependent. The different types of Urn models such as bernoulii, polya and balancing can all be used to determine these different outcomes and probabilities. It was also interesting to learn about random walks as the value at the time depends on the cumulative value of the history before time. 
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed 
Originally our group hadn't been communicating regularly and not much work had been made. This was originally very stressful because we had not been on top of work and keeping up. Our tutor established clear assessment guidelines and steps that we should be following to be on top of group work and keep track of the different parts. This meant good group communication was necessary to be able to achieve this.
	
I also didn't realise where to discussions were for the previous weeks and these hadn't been completed. This meant that this week I had to catch up on several different ones that I had missed over the past few weeks. However I have been keeping up with the weekly reflections and submitting them on GitHub each week. As well as doing the pre work and looking at the canvas pages before the lesson which has been very helpful to understand and learn at my potential during the workshops.
	
## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
	
This week we had to choose a team leader and a team topic however we had not spoken prior to the lesson starting. During the lesson we did decide to have a 30 minute group call after to brainstorm different ideas and pick a leader. This was the first group call that we had and as we didn't know each other very well this did go well. One of the girls was willing to be team leader which was very helpful as no one else particularly wanted to do this job. During the call everyone was contributing and expressing their opinion which was very helpful to get a range of opinions and know that everyone was participating. We decided on the topic of corona virus affecting the housing market and decided to brainstorm different models that would best suit this idea. Which we checked with our tutor to make sure that it was the best outcome. During this call we also allocated different jobs and tasks for each individual to complete within the next few weeks, which we will check up on later. As this was our first call I think that it went fairly well and hopefully everyone will complete their parts and the group assignment can go smoothly. 

# Week 7 reflection
## What have i learnt this week?
Module 7 consisted of complexity and emergent behaviour within different models which was very interesting. Learning about the Schelling segregation model was interesting to look at complex interactions in networks through tipping points. E.g. The exodus tip when one person leaves causes the similarity percentage of another person to drop below a threshold such that this person leaves as well. Whereas the genesis tip occurs when someone moves in and lowers the similarity wanted percentage such as to cause someone of the opposite characteristic to move out. I was also particularly interested in the coordination and culture aspects of this class such as tyler, boaz and trilling. It was interesting to see different people's opinions on this topic and how this works with other models. As well as coordination and consistency these values of meaning and different models looked at the consistency and errors that occur. 
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed ?
Although last week one of my weakness' was incomplete discussion contributions to canvas. This week I was able to navigate canvas and find out where these discussions were being posted, here I caught up and wrote my opinions for each section. After completing this I also read fellow peers discussion posts and opinions which gave me some new insights and ideas about the different topics. This meant that I was all caught up and I also completed my reflection earlier. I am also staying on top of reading notes before the class so that I am aware of what will be happening before the lesson. 
	
However due to the amount of university work and other subjects having assessments, this has meant that I haven't been able to focus on this group assignment. I haven't had very good organisation with doing this regularly so during the STUVAC I am hoping to make a very good start in the research component of this assignment. As well as collating all the different notes that I have been taking during and before class to best use for the different models. 
	
## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
	
We have finally agreed on a topic from last weeks call and this has been approved by the tutor. We were able to successfully choose a team captain and also divide the work appropriately between the different group members. We have had a few texts during this week just to make sure everyone is on the same page. One of the biggest challenges is the amount of university work everyone has, as everyone has very busy lives and many assessments due. This has meant that not a lot of work has been done on the google doc at the moment. However hopefully after STUVAC we are going to call after class again and regroup to make sure that everyone has completed their parts and are on the right track.   As this will be a key step in making sure that everyone is following the right direction for the future of the assignment. 

# Week 8 reflection

## What have i learnt this week?
Module 8 built on complexity and emergent behaviour particularly looking at different strategies and constructing models to get an advantage over competitors. By looking at emergent behaviours this allowed an observation and understanding of dynamics, boundaries, energy and environment for the whole system context. I also learnt about the Colonel Blotto game which is used to predict the winners and losers based on the allocation of limited resources across different fronts. Whoever has the most resources at the front wins and to win overall you have to have the most fronts. This looks at a model that has no particular strategy at winning, as you can get lucky from it and weak players still have a shot at winning depending on their allocation of resources. This was really interesting to look at a different approach of a model and solving problems which can be useful for our assessment. These were the main points of focus as this weeks workshop was slightly shorter to allow more time for group work.
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed 
I was able to complete my parts of the assignment on time and to a high standard for the other group members. I was unsure about the rich picture but after researching and asking Juan, I now have a better idea of what needs to be included. For the end of the week, I need to edit over my writing and add a few more details to the end parts. It  was very useful having STUVAC to get ahead and also catch up on different parts and other subjects. Similarly I have also completed my reflection earlier this week, but need to contribute to the week 8 discussion which I will do after the assessment is handed in. 
	
## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
This week we have a draft of sections 1,2,3 which we had previously sectioned off and split off to different group members several weeks ago. I had been working on my sections the last couple of weeks in the google doc and no one else had put in their sections. However this was because everyone had been working individually on their sections in different documents and at the end of the class had put them in. This was really helpful for everyone to look over and edit people's work. As well as this we had been communicating very well throughout the week keeping everyone on track. However we did have several issues with Github and Python which were resolved by one of group members having a call with Juan to fix this problem after class. So far the team work is on track because we have kept organised and have good communication which will hopefully carry out throughout the rest of the semester. 

We also had another issue of someone thinking they were in our group when they weren't. This was because it said their name on canvas however they had not been contributing to any discussions, nor on the chat or even showing up to class. We helped them become part of another group, but if he were to join our group that would have been very unfair as we had already assigned and completed parts. Rather than just joining and messaging one of the members several days before the assessment was due. 

# Reflection week 9

## What have I learnt this week?
	
This week and for the next few weeks there isn't any content within the weekly workshops. This is because our groups are all focusing on working on the assessment that is due at the end of week 12. Which gives us additional time for all group members to be online and participating ensuring everyone is on the same page and getting tasks completed.
	
As we submitted our draft in week 8, it was hard to progress completely into the next section of the assessment without marks and feedback. However Juan has said that we should be receiving marks and feedback on Friday, giving us more direction to plan for next lesson and the next few weeks. 
	
## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
	
The beginning of the workshop was just a general explanation about the plan for the next few weeks, working in our teams and what needs to be done. All groups were split into their breakout rooms to discuss the progressing steps needed for the future. As we were very uncertain about how to tackle 4,5,6 we requested Juan to be in our group and to step us through this process. Before he joined we had discussed different aspects of the assessment that we needed to clarify and any other queries. During this call I mostly asked and clarified the questions for the group. 
	
After this call we organised all the necessary and different parts, in particular how we should address python. As no one in the group had any specific coding experience or knowledge about this area. It makes it very difficult to know the direction and steps necessary for this section of the assessment. It was good to see each individual contributing to the discussion and dividing of the parts, especially if there were any individual concerns that needed to be addressed by the whole group. The other three members of my group also had a large assessment due the following day, this meant that after organising we agreed to follow up and meet next week. To allow them to work on their assessment because it is important to consider that individuals have different commitments and other things going on in their lives. I also made sure that all things discussed and allocated were put into the google doc to make it easily accessible for members to work on their parts during their own time. Our group leader also made sure that Githib was accessible and to follow through with feedback and marks later in the week. So far our team has worked very well and effectively to complete the different parts of the assessment, as each individual has brought different skills and opinions that are useful. These different perspectives are necessary to create a well rounded and developed project about our topic of Corona Virus in the housing market. 
	
# Reflection week 10
## What have I learnt this week?
This week's workshop started with a general introduction and building on last week's theory. From there Juan split us into our break out rooms to continue working on our assessment and having discussions to improve. After receiving feedback from an external marker this allowed us to analyse and interpret this. Similarly we were able to review the feedback from our peers and their opinions about the positives and negatives about our assessment. There were several main positives including good analysis and wording of information, the choice of a relevant issue and use of graphs. However, several people said that there needed to different perspectives about Corona virus in the housing market including some positives. As there was a main interpretation that this opinion was mainly negative. Similarly some areas of pictures and text needed to be fixed in the formatting but this was the fault of GitHub.  
	
The overall feedback from the marker was mostly positive which was very exciting to see that we were on the right track. For my introduction part I need to include some positives and some solutions for Corona Virus and flesh out more of the Markov model. However Juan told us that some of this feedback isn't as relevant and we should just continue working on our parts. 

## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
	
After reviewing the feedback from the marker and our peers we continued discussing the progressing steps for the future. However, we waited for Juan to give us more detailed feedback in the breakout room. From this we divided our parts based on our models and will fix our current parts for next weeks workshop. There were some parts of the zoom call where there wasn't much engagement or speaking from all the team members. So we stopped this earlier to let everyone work on their parts and other assessments that they had due. This was a fairly quiet week compared to others, as it just required continuing previous work that was already assigned and there was no new content.
