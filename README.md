# 41189-Reflective-portfolio Week 1: Systems 
## What have I learnt this week?
Knowing very little about human centred complex systems this was a very interesting introduction as I was very unsure what this subject was about. 
I also began to learn how to use canvas as a learning tool as i had never used it before with none of my subjects being on there. This meant finding the layout and set up of this subject which was divided into pre, during and post work. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
It was very interesting looking at the meaning of systems, 'group of interacting/ interrelated entities that form a united whole'. Which made me question the different systems around me and their different roles involved. As systems has been a word that has been used freely to describe many things I didn't realise the variety and complexity of this meaning. In particularly the complexity of these systems and the way that they must adapt to survive and play an important role.
## What insights have I gained?
I have learnt about the different boundaries and characteristics of systems, which I was very unaware of before. Ultimately many different things can be systems depending on their boundaries, surroundings and influences to make it an open, closed or isolated system. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have learnt that I know information about these topics, but i need to refine my language and details about the topics. As this is all a very new learning experience and I need to stay organised and on top of the work to do well. There is a lot of new terminology as well which means i need to ensure i have done the pre and post work as well as textbook areas to help me learn. 

# Week2 models
## What have I learnt this week?
	
This weeks focus was on the importance of models and this gave me an insight into the complexity and variety of these different models. As people use models in their day to day life this structure can vary to different degrees because models are a substitute of a system. Helping people to visualise and execute ideas that they may have. There were many different important examples that were used throughout helping to create a better understanding about these models. It was important to know the one to many approach as some models can be applicable to many different cases, but also unique individual models are necessary to be the most accurate. 
	
## What do I now know that I did not before?
	
In particular I learnt about the different approaches for the types of models that are appropriate for individual unique situations. The embodiment approach focuses on realism for models that are necessary to make change and necessary for day to day life like traffic systems. Whereas the analogy approach captures the process of the system e.g. The spreading of a disease and how this can be controlled and stopped. Finally an alternative reality is used to rediscover general insights and doesn't really represent or capture reality. I also found modelling vs. Observation a very important topic area that was covered, letting me think about other decisions I had made in previous tasks.
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed 
As I had done the pre-work to a high standard  and before the tutorial, this meant that I had a good foundational knowledge to know and understand what the tutor was talking about during the tutorial. I was able to pick up more information, ideas and different insights building on my current knowledge. However I need to learn the technical information better to strengthen my understanding. Similarly it would be a good idea to do my reflections on the day or day after to remember the full representation of my experience.
