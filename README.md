# 41189-Reflective-portfolio Week 1: Systems 
## What have I learnt this week?
Knowing very little about human centred complex systems this was a very interesting introduction as I was very unsure what this subject was about. 
I also began to learn how to use canvas as a learning tool as i had never used it before with none of my subjects being on there. This meant finding the layout and set up of this subject which was divided into pre, during and post work. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
It was very interesting looking at the meaning of systems, 'group of interacting/ interrelated entities that form a united whole'. Which made me question the different systems around me and their different roles involved. As systems has been a word that has been used freely to describe many things I didn't realise the variety and complexity of this meaning. In particularly the complexity of these systems and the way that they must adapt to survive and play an important role.
## What insights have I gained?
I have learnt about the different boundaries and characteristics of systems, which I was very unaware of before. Ultimately many different things can be systems depending on their boundaries, surroundings and influences to make it an open, closed or isolated system. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have learnt that I know information about these topics, but i need to refine my language and details about the topics. As this is all a very new learning experience and I need to stay organised and on top of the work to do well. There is a lot of new terminology as well which means i need to ensure i have done the pre and post work as well as textbook areas to help me learn.
