# 41189-Reflective-portfolio Week 1: Systems 
## What have I learnt this week?
Knowing very little about human centred complex systems this was a very interesting introduction as I was very unsure what this subject was about. 
I also began to learn how to use canvas as a learning tool as i had never used it before with none of my subjects being on there. This meant finding the layout and set up of this subject which was divided into pre, during and post work. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
It was very interesting looking at the meaning of systems, 'group of interacting/ interrelated entities that form a united whole'. Which made me question the different systems around me and their different roles involved. As systems has been a word that has been used freely to describe many things I didn't realise the variety and complexity of this meaning. In particularly the complexity of these systems and the way that they must adapt to survive and play an important role.
## What insights have I gained?
I have learnt about the different boundaries and characteristics of systems, which I was very unaware of before. Ultimately many different things can be systems depending on their boundaries, surroundings and influences to make it an open, closed or isolated system. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have learnt that I know information about these topics, but i need to refine my language and details about the topics. As this is all a very new learning experience and I need to stay organised and on top of the work to do well. There is a lot of new terminology as well which means i need to ensure i have done the pre and post work as well as textbook areas to help me learn. 

# Week2 models
## What have I learnt this week?
	
This weeks focus was on the importance of models and this gave me an insight into the complexity and variety of these different models. As people use models in their day to day life this structure can vary to different degrees because models are a substitute of a system. Helping people to visualise and execute ideas that they may have. There were many different important examples that were used throughout helping to create a better understanding about these models. It was important to know the one to many approach as some models can be applicable to many different cases, but also unique individual models are necessary to be the most accurate. 
	
## What do I now know that I did not before?
	
In particular I learnt about the different approaches for the types of models that are appropriate for individual unique situations. The embodiment approach focuses on realism for models that are necessary to make change and necessary for day to day life like traffic systems. Whereas the analogy approach captures the process of the system e.g. The spreading of a disease and how this can be controlled and stopped. Finally an alternative reality is used to rediscover general insights and doesn't really represent or capture reality. I also found modelling vs. Observation a very important topic area that was covered, letting me think about other decisions I had made in previous tasks.
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed 
As I had done the pre-work to a high standard  and before the tutorial, this meant that I had a good foundational knowledge to know and understand what the tutor was talking about during the tutorial. I was able to pick up more information, ideas and different insights building on my current knowledge. However I need to learn the technical information better to strengthen my understanding. Similarly it would be a good idea to do my reflections on the day or day after to remember the full representation of my experience. 

# *Reflection week 3
  ## What have i learnt this week?
 
	I have applied previous knowledge about models from last weeks workshop, to be able to build on the new examples and applications in this weeks learning materials. It was very interesting looking at the different models of signalling which identify various conditions under which people send costly signals to reveal information or their type. This can look at things such as conspicuous consumption entailing what other people think of us and what we consume signals our status to others e.g. Buying an expensive car. Whereas cost signalling looks at the meaning or significance that a person attaches to something which is felt in direct proportion to the expense at which it is communicated. This can include hidden action and information by people which is only demonstrated through outcomes. 
	
## What do i now know that i did not before?
	Particularly looking at value and power it was interesting to see these different measures as well as cooperative games to assist with this. The last on the bus value looks at the actor's marginal contribution given that the group has already formed. Whereas shapely value looks at the actor's average marginal contribution across all possible sequences of adding people to a group. 
	
	As well as problem solving the process of perspectives → Heuristics → Team diversity → Recombination = Innovation was a process that was interesting to read about and understand. 
	
## What were the challenges i have encountered or observed and how well did I/ my team handle them?
	We have just formed groups for upcoming group and team assignments, i am in a team of four. One of the girls I have worked with previously in another subject last semester however I have never met her, but I know that we work fairly well together and get along. It will be a challenge working together with the two other girls later in the semester as I don't really know anything about them as a person or their abilities. But as the weeks go buy hopefully we can organise well and achieve tasks. We have established a communication group and platform as well which is a good progressing start.
	
# *Reflection week 4
	
## What have i learnt this week?
	
This week allowed me to thoroughly build on my previous knowledge of systems and models from the other workshops. To also being able to add different areas about networks. I learnt about the dynamic and evolving nature of systems and how they have boundaries and different parts. As systems are defined by their interrelationships, functionality and potential which can be affected when one system is taken away from another. These boundaries can be macro and micro e.g. A pool vs. An ocean this size is very different. I also enjoyed learning about the different fundamental modes of interaction including exponential growth, goal setting and oscillation demonstrating how systems interact with each other. 

## What insights have i gained?
	Through learning this theory, it was also very interesting to watch a video at the end of the lesson which put together all the different theories and information that we had learnt. And to see it being used and applied to a real life example, this was particularly interesting to see big business' taking action. 
	
## What are my strengths/ weakness' that i have observed 
Similarly to other weeks, I have found a strength in my learning habits through doing the pre work early and before the commencement of the lesson. This makes it much easier for me to retain the information as the tutor is talking about it, rather than learning it for the first time. Which helps enhance my understanding and learning abilities across these topics.
	
I have also found cross over with some of the theory in this class with the other subjects that I have been doing. Which makes it easier to understand and expand my knowledge as well as previous subjects that i have done. Such as learning about nodes and network formations. 
	
However I have become less motivated to write my reflections after class, as my schedule for the second half of the week is fairly busy. But I am trying to do this earlier even if it means planning the reflection after class and then writing it later in the week. As this is a very important life skill and learning tool that is necessary.
